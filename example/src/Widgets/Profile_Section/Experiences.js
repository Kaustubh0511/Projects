        INTERNSHIP KPIT TECHNOLOGIES(December 2023 â€“ July 2024) Position :-
        Graduate Engineer Trainee I became proficient in current C++
        (C++11/14/17) as a software development intern, which helped me write
        effective and maintainable software. To maximize memory management, I
        made use of lambda functions, functional composition, and smart
        pointers.,to improve code reusability. I used design patterns including
        Factory, Observer, and Singleton. I also gained insights in socket
        programming for reliable network connectivity. I worked with Agile
        approaches, including Scrum, and utilized GitHub for collaborative
        development and version control in an efficient manner. I constantly
        produced excellent code in fast-paced team settings during my
        internship, putting an emphasis on responsive project management and
        iterative development.
